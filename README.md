# Readme
hi there welcome to this small repositories of mine, i believe anything you want to find isn't here
i mainly uses this github as an archive for my writeup on CTFs, and some school project
feel free to tinker around, tho it'll be a waste of time

# Aboutme
languange barrier doesnt stop me tbh, i can speak english pretty fluently, a bit of japanese.

I am currently hunting various cybersecurity certifications and opportunities to gain hands-on experience. My experience includes self-study and participation in cybersecurity communities and events. I am looking to work in blue, red, or purple team roles and am eager to buildi my skills and expertise in the field.
