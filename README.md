# Readme
hi there welcome to this small repositories of mine, i believe anything you want to find isn't here
i mainly uses this github as an archive for my writeup on CTFs, and some school project
feel free to tinker around, tho it'll be a waste of time, im dorry for the unorganized, and some uncompleted work ive made here.

# Aboutme
languange barrier doesnt stop me tbh, i can speak english pretty fluently, a bit of japanese.
I'm a sophomore student majoring cybersecurity and having a strong interest in CTFs and actively seek opportunities to learn about different field of cybersecurity. I am looking to gain hands-on experience in the related field. currently i am learning from HackTheBox and some CTFs (either local or international CTFs). My experience includes self-study and participation in cybersecurity communities and events. I am looking to work in blue, red, or purple team roles and am eager to buildi my skills and expertise in the field.
