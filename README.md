<p>Eeehhh i don't know how to make a great self-introduction... and pardon my bad english
so...</p>
<br>
<p>basically... technically... i'm an introvert and a self-taught "don't know what to do" type of human. I'm a student in Bina Nusantara University taking a major in cybersecurity (choosen accidentally), i am no special, just a human who loves to try make something with delusion, all this is a delusion of me. Yes im a chuunibyou.</p>
